At Arpeggeo® we believe that geostatistical knowledge is key to advance **machine learning** technology in
industries that manage **geospatial resources** (e.g., mining, energy, agriculture)

We help

- **Decision makers** plan activities more quickly and online as geospatial data becomes available
- **Geoscientists** build geospatial models more easily with artificial intelligence methodologies
- **Data scientists** customize geospatial workflows with our advanced open-source software

All through **research** and **development** of custom high-performance solutions powered by [Julia](https://julialang.org).
